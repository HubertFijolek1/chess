# Chess Application Development Plan

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Chess Application. The project is divided into multiple versions, each with specific features and enhancements.

## Version 1.0: Basic Chess Board and Piece Movement

### Version 1.0.1: Initial Setup
- **Chess Board Representation**:
  - Create an 8x8 grid.
  - Initialize the board without pieces.

### Version 1.0.2: Piece Placement
- **Placeholders for Pieces**:
  - Define placeholders for each piece in their starting positions on the board.

### Version 1.0.3: Display Board
- **Display Method**:
  - Implement a method to print the board to the console with placeholders for pieces.

## Version 1.1: Piece Classes and Movement

### Version 1.1.1: Define Piece Classes
- **Piece Classes**:
  - Create base class `ChessPiece`.
  - Create subclasses for King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn.

### Version 1.1.2: Initialize Board with Pieces
- **Piece Initialization**:
  - Update the board to use instances of piece classes in their starting positions.

### Version 1.1.3: Basic Move Logic
- **Move Validation**:
  - Implement basic move validation for each piece type.

### Version 1.1.3.1: User Input Handling and Parse Position
- **User Input Handling**:
  - Added input prompts in the `main` function for user moves.
  - Split user input into start and end positions.
- **Parse Position**:
  - Implemented the `parse_position` function to convert input into row and column indices.

### Version 1.1.3.2: Add `move_piece` Method and `self.current_turn` Attribute
- **Move Piece Method**:
  - Added the `move_piece` method in the `Board` class to handle piece movement and validation.
- **Current Turn Attribute**:
  - Added the `self.current_turn` attribute to track the player's turn.

### Version 1.1.3.3: Implement Move Logic for Rook and Bishop
- **Rook Move Logic**:
  - Rooks move any number of squares along a row or column.
  - Ensured the path between start and end is clear.
- **Bishop Move Logic**:
  - Bishops move any number of squares diagonally.
  - Ensured the path between start and end is clear.

### Version 1.1.3.4: Implement Move Logic for King and Queen
- **King Move Logic**:
  - Kings move one square in any direction.
- **Queen Move Logic**:
  - Queens move any number of squares along a row, column, or diagonal.
  - Ensured the path between start and end is clear.

### Version 1.1.3.5: Implement Move Logic for Knight and Pawn
- **Knight Move Logic**:
  - Knights move in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.
- **Pawn Move Logic**:
  - Pawns move forward one square, with the option to move two squares on their first move.
  - Pawns capture diagonally.

## Version 2.0: Enhanced Move Validation and Special Moves

### Version 2.0.1: Check and Checkmate Detection
- **Check Detection**:
  - Implement logic to detect when a king is in check.
- **Checkmate Detection**:
  - Implement logic to determine checkmate conditions.

### Version 2.0.2: Special Moves
- **Castling**:
  - Implement castling rules for both sides.
- **En Passant**:
  - Implement en passant capture for pawns.
- **Pawn Promotion**:
  - Allow pawns to be promoted upon reaching the opposite end of the board.

## Version 3.0: Game State Management

### Version 3.0.1: Game Initialization and Reset
- **Game Initialization**:
  - Start a new game.
  - Reset the board to initial positions.

### Version 3.0.2: Move History
- **Move History**:
  - Track and display move history.

### Version 3.0.3: Undo and Redo Moves
- **Undo/Redo Moves**:
  - Implement undo and redo functionality.

### Version 3.0.4: Save and Load Game
- **Save and Load Game**:
  - Save the game state to a file.
  - Load a saved game state.

## Version 4.0: Basic AI

### Version 4.0.1: AI Class
- **AI Opponent**:
  - Implement a basic AI to play against.

### Version 4.0.2: AI Algorithm
- **Decision-Making Algorithm**:
  - Use a basic decision-making algorithm (e.g., Minimax).

## Version 5.0: User Interface

### Version 5.0.1: Basic GUI
- **Graphical User Interface**:
  - Create a GUI using Tkinter.
  - Display the chessboard and pieces.
  - Allow users to make moves via the GUI.

### Version 5.0.2: Interactive Elements

### Version 6.0.2: Game Analysis
- **Game Analysis**:
  - Provide basic game analysis (e.g., detecting blunders).

### Version 6.0.3: Customization
- **Customization Options**:
  - Allow customization of board and piece appearance.
